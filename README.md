# Overview
This project implements a spam message classifier using Python and machine learning techniques. The classifier is designed to detect spam messages and categorize them accurately. It leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify messages based on their content.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a robust spam message classification model to automatically filter out spam messages. This is useful for improving email management, enhancing communication efficiency, and providing insights into spam message characteristics.

# Features 

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares text data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Converts text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
Classification: Uses the Naive Bayes algorithm for spam detection.
Visualization: Generates word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in spam messages.
Performance Evaluation: Assesses the model's accuracy and performance metrics.
