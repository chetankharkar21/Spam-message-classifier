Project Overview: Spam Message Classifier

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).

**1. Data Collection

Source: Dataset containing labeled text messages with "spam" and "ham" labels.
Format: Typically in CSV format with columns for message text and label.

**2. Data Preprocessing

Text Vectorization:
Tool: TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.
Function: Converts raw text into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
Parameters:
lowercase=True: Convert all text to lowercase.
stop_words='english': Remove common English stop words.
Data Splitting:
Tool: train_test_split from sklearn.
Function: Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Parameters: Stratified split to maintain the proportion of classes.

**3. Model Training

Model Selection: Naive Bayes Classifier.
Tool: MultinomialNB from sklearn.
Function: Implements a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with a multinomial distribution.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Tool: GridSearchCV from sklearn.
Function: Performs exhaustive search over specified hyperparameter values to find the best model.
Parameters:
alpha: Smoothing parameter.
fit_prior: Whether to learn class prior probabilities.

**4. Model Evaluation

Metrics:
Confusion Matrix:
Tool: confusion_matrix from sklearn.
Function: Computes the matrix to evaluate the accuracy of classification.
Classification Report:
Tool: classification_report from sklearn.
Function: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
F1 Score:
Tool: f1_score from sklearn.
Function: Measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

**5. Model Serialization

Tools: joblib from joblib.
Functions:
dump(): Saves the trained model and vectorizer to disk.
load(): Loads the model and vectorizer for future use or deployment.

**6. Prediction

Process:
Load the saved model and vectorizer.
Transform new text messages using the vectorizer.
Use the model to predict whether the message is spam or ham.

**7. Deployment

Integration: Deploy the trained model in an application or service for real-time classification.
Challenges and Solutions
Class Imbalance: Adjusted model evaluation strategies to account for class imbalance.
Model Tuning: Employed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
